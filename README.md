# Refactor 

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to see how the different stocks performed in 2 years i.e. 2017 and 2018. To see how the total volume of each stock traded in the whole year. Also, in order to see the performance of the stock and its growth , strating from the value of stock from the begining and its comparison at the end of the year.

As you can see from images that the code run time is way lesser when we use refactored code than the all stock analysis code. The refactored code runs almot 6 times faster than the code without arrays. 
#### 2017
From the Analysis of all the stocks we can see that in the year 2017, the highest traded stock was SPWR which had a total trading volume of 782 Million the 2nd highest was FSLR but the fact that the returns on FSLR are 5 times higher than the most traded stock in 2017 makes it much more favourable too invest. The calculations also show us that the DQ performed best in terms of returns and gained almost 200% return on its value from the first time it was traded in the year. 
###### Key figures for 2017 :
Top 2 performing stocks in terms of returns : 
1: DQ   with 199.4 % return, Total trading volume = 35.8 Million approx
2: SEDG with 184.5 % return, Total trading volume = 206.8 Million
Top 2 Traded Stocks:
1:SPWR  Total trading volume 706 Milliom
2:FSLR  Totalk trading volume 684 Million
#### 2018
Wherease in 2018  when we look at the same stocks, it clearly shows that it was not a good year for traders. The total trading volume increases slightly from last year but the return on the stoks was in negative only 2 out of 12 stocks gained by the year end wheraese in 2017 11 stocks earned return for the investors.  

## Summary: 
#### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring the code runs by the principle that there is always room for improvement.The improvement in coding is based on 3 Rs, Reusability, Runtime, Readability. The advantages of refactoring rovolve around these principles. Refactoring makes the code more efficient in many ways. The main disadvantage is that its usually more complicated to come up with a better verison of an already running code. 
#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
These pros and cons apply to the very core of the VBA scripting , from the run times seen in the pictures,it is evident that after refactoring the run time reduced with very huge margin. And the code is now in better poistion to handle a larger amount of data. It is also more felxible to adapt to new addition of stocks as we used arrays to run the loop.
